            <p>You're tired of being broke...</p>
            
            <p>You've probably tried the usual stuff. Door Dash until 2 AM. Selling random junk on Facebook Marketplace. Maybe even one of those "make money online" courses that promised you'd be rich by Christmas.</p>
            
            <p>But you're still here. Still asking mom for gas money. Still watching your high school friends post about their new apartments while you're stuck in the same dead-end situation.</p>
            
            <p>Here's what really stings...</p>
            
            <p>Every month that passes, you fall further behind. Your girlfriend's starting to ask uncomfortable questions. Your buddies stopped inviting you out because they know you'll say "I'm broke."</p>
            
            <p>And the worst part? <span class="highlight">You KNOW you're capable of more.</span> You just need someone to show you a real path that doesn't require a business degree or $10,000 in startup cash.</p>
            
            <p>What if I told you there's a way to start making serious money in the next 90 days... with nothing but a $500 investment and the willingness to get your hands dirty?</p>

            <h2>How a Broke College Kid Built a $15K/Month Empire... Starting in His Driveway</h2>
            
            <p>Two years ago, I was exactly where you are right now.</p>
            
            <p>Dead broke. Living off ramen noodles. Watching my bank account hover around $47 while my friends were landing internships at tech companies.</p>
            
            <p>I tried everything. Uber (made like $6/hour after gas). Selling stuff online (lost money on shipping). Even signed up for one of those pyramid scheme things my cousin was pushing.</p>
            
            <p>Nothing worked.</p>
            
            <p>Then one day, I was scrolling Instagram and saw this guy posting pictures of cars that looked like they belonged in a magazine. Not exotic cars. Regular cars that somehow looked... perfect.</p>
            
            <p>The comments were insane. "How much do you charge?" "Can you do my car next?" "Take my money!"</p>
            
            <p>That's when it hit me...</p>
            
            <p>Everyone has a car. Everyone wants their car to look good. But most people either don't have the time or don't know how to make it happen.</p>
            
            <p>Here's what nobody tells you about car detailing: <span class="highlight">It's not about the fancy equipment or expensive chemicals.</span> The guys making real money aren't the ones with $50,000 vans and industrial steamers.</p>
            
            <p>They're the ones who figured out the simple system. The right tools. The right process. And most importantly... the right way to get customers without begging on Facebook.</p>

            <h2>The $500 Detailing System That Changes Everything</h2>
            
            <p>Forget everything you think you know about starting a detailing business.</p>
            
            <p>You don't need a van. You don't need $5,000 in equipment. You definitely don't need to print flyers and knock on doors like it's 1995.</p>
            
            <p>Here's what actually works:</p>
            
            <div class="bullets">
                <div class="bullet"><strong>The Right Tools (Under $300):</strong> Specific equipment that delivers professional results without breaking the bank - so you look like a pro from day one, not some kid with a garden hose</div>
                
                <div class="bullet"><strong>Professional-Grade Chemicals (Under $200):</strong> The exact products that make cars shine like glass - so customers post pictures and brag to their friends about your work</div>
                
                <div class="bullet"><strong>Simple Service Packages:</strong> Three basic offerings that customers understand instantly - so you never have to explain what you do or justify your prices</div>
                
                <div class="bullet"><strong>Digital Customer Acquisition:</strong> A simple Google Ads + website system that brings customers to YOU - so you never have to beg for work or compete on price</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>Here's proof it works...</p>
            
            <p>Month 1: I booked 12 cars at $150 each. $1,800 profit.</p>
            <p>Month 3: 31 cars. $4,650 profit.</p>
            <p>Month 6: 47 cars. $7,050 profit.</p>
            <p>Month 12: Hired two guys. $15,400 profit.</p>
            
            <p>The difference? I stopped trying to compete with car washes on price and started positioning myself as the guy who makes your car look better than the day you bought it.</p>

            <p>This is different.</p>
            
            <p>You get direct access to me through Instagram DMs. You get the exact shopping list I used to start. You get the pricing structure that makes customers happy to pay premium rates.</p>

            <p>Spending $30,000 on a van before they've booked a single customer. Buying random chemicals from AutoZone that barely work. Printing flyers that go straight in the trash.</p>

            <h2>But What If...</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Q: "I don't have $500 to spend upfront."</div>
                <p>Start with even less. You can begin with $300 and upgrade your tools as you make money. The first car you detail will pay for half your equipment. Most guys make their investment back in the first week.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Q: "What if this doesn't work for me?"</div>
                <p>Look, I can't make you successful. But I can show you exactly what worked for me and hundreds of other guys. If you follow the system exactly as I lay it out, you'll get customers. The demand is there - people want their cars detailed.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Q: "I've never run a business before. What if I mess it up?"</div>
                <p>Perfect. That means you don't have bad habits to unlearn. I started with zero business experience too. This isn't rocket science - it's washing cars really well and finding customers who appreciate quality work.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Q: "How long before I see results?"</div>
                <p>Most guys book their first paying customer within 2 weeks. If you hustle and follow the system, you can easily hit $2,000+ in your first month. This isn't some long-term investment - it's designed to make you money fast.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Q: "What if there are already detailers in my area?"</div>
                <p>Good. That means there's demand. Most of your "competition" is either overpriced (targeting luxury car owners) or terrible quality (competing with car washes). You'll be right in the sweet spot - premium quality at fair prices.</p>
